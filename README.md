# adaptive_eq

This repo includes:
- Implementations of Least Mean Squares and Recursive Least Squares algorithms for adaptive equalization purposes. 
- MMSE Equalizer implementations based on the updated channel parameters.
- Channel parameters, therefore MMSE Equalizer coefficients, are updated at the beginning of each received block
- SNR vs. BER measurements obtained with Monte Carlo simulations.
